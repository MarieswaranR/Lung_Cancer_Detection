Lung Cancer Detection Project
!Lungs

Overview
The Lung Cancer Detection Project aims to detect lung cancer using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical images (such as CT scans), we can identify potential cancerous regions and assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

Features
Image Preprocessing: We preprocess raw medical images to enhance features relevant to lung cancer detection.
Deep Learning Models: Our models (such as convolutional neural networks) learn from labeled data to classify regions as healthy or potentially cancerous.
Visualization: We visualize model predictions and highlight areas of interest within lung images.
Performance Metrics: We evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lung-cancer-detection.git

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
We obtained our lung cancer image dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes a collection of medical images (such as CT scans and X-rays) relevant to lung cancer detection. Each image has been labeled as either healthy or potentially cancerous.

Dataset Details
Source: Kaggle
Link: Lung Cancer Image Dataset
Description: The dataset contains a total of N images, with M healthy samples and K potentially cancerous samples.
Feel free to explore the dataset further and cite any relevant research papers or sources that contributed to its creation.

Data Preparation:
Obtain labeled lung images (CT scans, X-rays, etc.).
Organize your dataset into train, validation, and test sets.
Model Training:
Train your deep learning model using the provided scripts.
Fine-tune hyperparameters and architecture as needed.
Evaluation and Visualization:
Evaluate your model’s performance on the test set.
Visualize predictions and highlight regions of interest.
